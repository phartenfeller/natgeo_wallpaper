# Natgeo Wallpaper

## What this does
It downloads the [National Geographic Photo of the day](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/photography/photo-of-the-day), saves it in a pics folder and sets it as the wallpaper.

I only tested it on Windows but it should also work on Mac OS and Linux.

## How to run it
`node index.js`

I copied the `wallpaper.bat` file in my autostart folder (Win + R -> `shell:startup`) on windows to run the script on startup.

## Roadmap
- [] Fix bug that sometimes the Background is black on Windows
- [] Add a better way to execute it on startup
